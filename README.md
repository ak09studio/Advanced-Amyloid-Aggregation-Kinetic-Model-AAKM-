Advanced Amyloid Aggregation Kinetic Model

This project implements a temperature-dependent amyloid aggregation model incorporating primary nucleation, elongation, secondary nucleation, and fragmentation dynamics. The system is solved numerically and parameters are globally optimized using differential evolution
